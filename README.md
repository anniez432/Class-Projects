# Class-Projects

Projects that I have created for past classes!

**CS200 (Programming I):**

_H8CustomApp_: Loan Calculator

_H12CustomApp_: User-Generated Movie Ratings

**CS300 (Programming II, Intro. to Object-Oriented Programming):**

_P01 Wardrobe Manager_: A Java program to manage wardrobe items utilizing procedural programming, array manipulation, and software testing with boolean tester methods.

_P06 Suitcase Packing_: A program developed with a partner for packing a suitcase with various strategies - rushed packing, greedy packing, and optimal packing.

_P07 Task Manager_: A task manager implemented with doubly-linked lists.

_P08 Mr. Markov_: A Markov Chain Model for text generation implemented and tested with stack and queue data structures.

_P09 Gradebook_: A binary search tree-based gradebook that uses BST operations and iterators. 

_P10 Prioritized Task Manager_: A task manager implemented with an array-based max-heap.

**CS400 (Programming III, Advanced DS & Software Engineering):**

_iSongly_: A Java application that allows users to interact with songs to 
filter them by year, loudness, and danceability. 
Files/algorithms I implemented:
<ol>
  <li>Backend: The backend for this app & BackendTests</li>
  <li>BinarySearchTree</li>
  <li>BSTRotation: BST that can rotate given valid nodes</li>
  <li>IterableRedBlackTree</li>
  <li>RedBlackTree</li>
  <li>SongComparator</li>
</ol>

All other files were created by my partner (zzou39@wisc.edu) and/or the UW-Madison CS400 staff.


_Campus Navigator WebApp_: A web application that users can interact with to find the shortest path between locations or the 10 closest destinations to a location on the UW-Madison campus.

Files/algorithms I implemented:
<ol>
  <li>Frontend: The frontend for this app & FrontendTests</li>
  <li>DijkstraGraph: a class that utilizes Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm between nodes.</li>
  <li>HashtableMap: stores key, value pairs in a map.</li>
</ol>

All other files were created by my partner (bisom@wisc.edu) and/or the UW-Madison CS400 staff.
